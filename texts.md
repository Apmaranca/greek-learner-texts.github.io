We're focused on producing high-quality, citable, consistently lemmatised editions of texts in the following categories:

* [19th/20th Century Easy Greek Readers](#19th20th-century-easy-greek-readers)
* [Plato](#plato)
* [Other Post-Beginner Greek Prose](#other-post-beginner-greek-prose)
* [Biblical and Early Christian Texts](#biblical-and-early-christian-texts)
* [New Testament Epitomes](#new-testament-epitomes)

as well as supporting the development of a born-digital reader: _Linguae Graecae Per Se Illustrata_ (LGPSI).

If there is any Greek prose appropriate for extensive reading that you're interested in helping add, see the [Guide for Shepherds](https://greek-learner-texts.github.io/guide_for_shepherds/).
