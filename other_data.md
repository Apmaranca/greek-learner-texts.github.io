## Vocabulary

As well as lemmatizing texts, we're developing a _learners' word list_ of a few thousand words. We're also developing a smaller list of _pictureable words_ with the goal of also providing openly-licensed illustrations to go with them.

See <https://github.com/greek-learner-texts/vocabulary-data> for overall data-wrangling in progress.

## Morphology

Largely independent of this project but still hopefully serving it, James has been working on a rich Morphological Lexicon of Ancient Greek for a number of years. This will include a database of stems and principal parts that will cover the texts of the GLTP and beyond.

More will be announced here soon.
