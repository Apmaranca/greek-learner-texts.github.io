organising collaboration on Ancient Greek texts and data for learners

## What We're Producing

* openly-licensed base texts following agreed-upon conventions
* tooling which produces a static website, EPUB, print-ready version, and (where appropriate) CTS TEI XML for contributing back to OGL / showing in Scaife
* corpus-based vocabulary lists for language learners (and producers of graded Greek reading material)
* linguistic annotation necessary to do things like track vocabulary, produce context-specific glosses, etc.

See:

* [Texts](https://greek-learner-texts.org/texts/) we're editing
* [Other Data](https://greek-learner-texts.org/other_data/) we're producing
* [Tools](https://greek-learner-texts.org/tools/) we're developing
