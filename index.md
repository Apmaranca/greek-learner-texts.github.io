The _Greek Learner Texts Project_ is a collaborative effort to produce openly-licensed texts in Ancient Greek for extensive reading.

## What We're Producing

* openly-licensed base texts following agreed-upon conventions
* tooling which produces online and print versions of the texts
* corpus-based vocabulary lists for language learners (and producers of graded Greek reading material)
* linguistic annotation necessary to do things like track vocabulary, produce context-specific glosses, etc.

See:

* [Texts](https://greek-learner-texts.org/texts/) we're editing
* [Other Data](https://greek-learner-texts.org/other_data/) we're producing
* [Tools](https://greek-learner-texts.org/tools/) we're developing
